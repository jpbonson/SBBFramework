# SBBFramework
Python implementation of **Symbiotic Bid-Based (SBB)** framework for problem decomposition using Genetic Programming (GP). This algorithm was developed by the NIMS laboratory, Dalhousie University, Canada.

This framework can be used in the following ways:

**Reinforcement Learning tasks (via sockets)**

1. implement a socket client that follows SBB socket interface (available below)

2. define a configuration

3. run SBB

4. run the socket client

- a simple socket client for tictactoe is available [here](https://github.com/jpbonson/SBBFramework/blob/master/SBB/tests/system_tests/tictactoe_game.py).

- sample configurations for this task are available [here](https://github.com/jpbonson/SBBFramework/tree/master/SBB/configs/sockets).

**Reinforcement Learning tasks (via code extension)**

1. implement a class that inherits SBB/environments/default_environment

2. add the new environment to _initialize_environment in SBB/sbb.py

3. define a configuration

4. run SBB

- a simple class implementation for tictactoe is available [here](https://github.com/jpbonson/SBBFramework/blob/master/SBB/environments/reinforcement/tictactoe/tictactoe_environment.py).

- sample configurations for this task are available [here](https://github.com/jpbonson/SBBFramework/tree/master/SBB/configs/tictactoe) for tictactoe and [here](https://github.com/jpbonson/SBBFramework/tree/master/SBB/configs/poker) for poker.

**Classification tasks**

1. add a .train and a .test file to SBB/datasets

2. define a configuration

3. run SBB

- sample configurations for this task are available [here](https://github.com/jpbonson/SBBFramework/tree/master/SBB/configs/classification).

- *warning: This framework was developed focusing on reinforcement learning, so it is not able to deal with big datasets.*

## 1. Introduction to SBB

**General Idea:**
- teams of programs evolve and compete over time
- each team represents a player in the game
- at each generation they play many matches against various opponents
- the best ones reproduce and keep evolving, the others are discarded

**Main Algorithms**:
- It follows the structure of a typical genetic algorithm:

- Modified with the SBB algorithm:

![](https://s13.postimg.org/6c28qgjsn/sbb.png "Overview of SBB")

- each team (host) is composed of 2 or more programs (symbionts)
- programs are composed of a set of instructions, registers and an action
- before a team executes an action:
   - all of its programs run over the inputs for the current match state
   - the action from the program with the highest output is selected as the team’s action
- a point is a game match, that represents the environment

## 3. How to Install

**Windows:**

Install [Anaconda for Python 2.7](http://continuum.io/downloads)

In the Windows console, type 'anaconda' before running the python commands.

**Ubuntu:**

Install the dependencies:
```
apt-get install build-essential python-dev pkg-config python-setuptools python-numpy python-scipy libatlas-dev libatlas3gf-base libfreetype6-dev python-pip
```

Then execute:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Obs.: You also have the option to use Anaconda for Ubuntu.

Obs.: You should also install the library 'python-pypoker-eval' if you want to generate poker hands.

## 4. How to Run

```
python main.py -f CONFIG_FILE
```

Various predefined configuration files are available [here](https://github.com/jpbonson/SBBFramework/tree/master/SBB/configs).

## 5. How to Test

```
nosetests
```

## 6. Socket Interface

All the messages have the format:
{'message_type': message_type, 'params': {}}

The server sends the following message types: ['new_match', 'perform_action']

The client sends the following message types: ['match_running', 'match_ended']

A match starts with a 'new_match' message from the server, then sequences of 'match_running' from the client and 'perform_action' from the server, until the client sends a 'match_ended'.

### Message Types:

**'new_match'**
- Informs the client that it should set up a new match.
- **Sent by:** server
- **Parameters:** 
    - 'mode': 'training', 'validation', or 'champion', can be used to debug (string)
    - 'match_id': can be used to debug (string)
    - 'opponent_label': used by the client, to know what opponent should be used to initialize the match (optional) (string)
    - 'point_label': used by the client, to know what label should be used to initialize the match (optional) (int)
        - for example, in the case of poker there are 9 labels, for 9 hands based on the player's strength and the opponent's strength, where the strength is [weak, intermediate, strong]
    - 'point_seed': used by the client, to know what seed should be used to initialize the match (optional) (int)
    - 'point_id': used by the client, to know what point should be used to initialize the match (optional) (int)

**'match_running'**
- Gives information about the match state to the server.
- **Sent by:** client
- **Parameters:** 
    - 'inputs': the current match state, all values must be between 0.0 and 10.0 (list of floats)
    - 'valid_actions': the valid actions for the current match state (list of ints)
    - 'current_player': 'sbb' or 'hall_of_fame', only is used if the hall of fame is enabled (string)
                            
**'perform_action'**
- Based on the match state, defines an action to execute in the client.
- **Sent by:** server
- **Parameters:** 
    - 'mode': 'training', 'validation', or 'champion', can be used to debug (string)
    - 'match_id': can be used to debug (string)
    - 'action': the chosen action (int)

**'match_ended'**
- Informs the server that the match ended.
- **Sent by:** client
- **Parameters:** 
    - 'result': a value from 0.0 to 1.0 indicating how the player performed in this match (float)
