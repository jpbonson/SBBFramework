# This file has a sample configuration for a very quick training of tictactoe players.
# The goal is just to see if everything is working, to train actual good players
# check the other configuration files.

# This file contains all possible configurations for SBB.

# Sample result:
#   Global Mean Validation Score per Validation per Run: [0.3875]
#   Best Team Validation Score per Validation per Run (champion): [0.3875]
#   Runtime: 0.04 mins
