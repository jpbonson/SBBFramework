# This file has a sample configuration for a training of tictactoe players.

# This file contains only configurations for reinforcement learning (without sockets).

# Sample result:
#   Global Mean Validation Score per Validation per Run: [0.43949]
#   Best Team Validation Score per Validation per Run (champion): [0.56937]
#   Runtime: 25 mins
